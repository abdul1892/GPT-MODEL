## ðŸ¤– GPT Model Fine-Tuning Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model on a custom dataset for domain-specific text generation. Fine-tuning allows the base model to adapt to specialized tasks, such as chatbot responses, content generation, or customer support automation, by learning from examples relevant to your specific application.

The fine-tuned model learns context, tone, and patterns from the training data to generate more accurate and contextually relevant outputs compared to the base GPT model.

## ðŸ”§ What Fine-Tuning Includes

- Preparing a dataset in prompt-completion format
- Tokenizing input using GPT-compatible tokenizers
- Training the model on a specific domain (e.g., medical Q&A, tech support)
- Evaluating generation quality and model loss
- Saving and reusing the fine-tuned model
